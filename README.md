## Vectrex Cradle

I'm learning to program in 6809 assembly to write simple Vectrex games. I have
created a grammar package for 6809 assembly for use with the [Atom Editor](http://atom.io)
you can find [here](https://atom.io/packages/language-6809).

A good resource of information on programming the Vectrex can be found [here](http://www.playvectrex.com/designit/chrissalo/toc.htm).
